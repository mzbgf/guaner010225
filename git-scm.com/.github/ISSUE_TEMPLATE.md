Please ONLY submit issues related to the git-scm Website (e.g. website-specific content, JS, or CSS that doesn't seem to be doing its job correctly) !

Make sure this is NOT an issue about :

     - the Git documentation (a.k.a. man/help pages, i.e. anything with a URL starting with https://git-scm.com/docs), which should be raised with the community at https://git-scm.com/community,
     - the contents of the Pro Git book (i.e. anything with a URL starting with https://git-scm.com/book or its PDF versions), which should be raised at https://github.com/progit/progit2/issues.
     - Git itself, which should also be raised with the community at https://git-scm.com/community, or
     - Git for Windows, which should be raised at https://github.com/git-for-windows/git.
