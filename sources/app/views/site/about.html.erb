  <h2>Open Source</h2>

  The content on this site is pulled from multiple sources. It is
  available under various licenses, and bugs reports should be directed
  to the appropriate repositories:

  <ul>

    <li>Most of the "base" site content is hosted in the
    <a href="https://github.com/git/git-scm.com">git/git-scm.com</a>
    repository at GitHub. That includes all pages except the book and
    manpages, along with the general design of the site. This content
    is available under the
    <a href="https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE.txt">MIT license</a>.
    Bug reports and suggestions may be made in that repository.

    <li>Content from the ProGit book is imported from the
    <a href="https://github.com/progit/progit2">progit/progit2</a>
    repository, which is available under a Creative Commons

    license, <a href="https://github.com/progit/progit2/blob/master/LICENSE.asc">
    as specified in the progit2 repository</a>. Bug reports and
    suggestions on the technical content or English language version of
    the book should be made in the progit2 repository. Fixes for
    translated versions of the book should be made in the
    <a href="https://github.com/progit/progit2/blob/master/TRANSLATING.md#helping-with-a-existing-project">
    appropriate language-specific repository</a>.
